This needs a thorough round of refactoring:
 - Check the poetry dependencies are all correct.
 - no way to init a new list file (use an empty dict in a file)
 - Used "item" and "entry" interchangably.
 - Not very impressed with Click.
 - Less duplicated setup code.
 - Need to test the CLI.
 - Naming is a bit Go-influenced, needs more underscores.
 - Too many different 'giftlist's
 - Allowed products isn't quite the right meaning. "Known" products might be better.
 - Use only one JSON library.
